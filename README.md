## Question 1: Complex Number Operations

### Problem Statement
Write a Java program to create a class representing complex numbers and implement methods for addition and multiplication of complex numbers.

### Solution Approach
- Create a Complex class with real and imaginary parts
- Implement methods for addition and multiplication of complex numbers
- Override the toString() method to display complex numbers in the standard format
- Demonstrate operations with example complex numbers

### Code Location
`Question_01/Main.java`

### Key Concepts
- Class design and implementation
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Operator overloading (achieved via methods in Java)
- String representation of objects

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How do you handle operator overloading in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Java doesn't support operator overloading directly like C++. Instead, we create methods like `add()` or `multiply()` to achieve similar functionality. For example, instead of writing `c1 + c2` for complex numbers, we write `c1.addComplex(c2)`. This approach is more explicit but less concise than true operator overloading.

2. **What is the significance of the toString() method?**
   - **Answer:** The `toString()` method provides a string representation of an object. When we override this method in our class, we can control how our objects are displayed when printed or concatenated with strings. Without overriding, Java would print the object's memory address, which isn't useful. In our Complex class, we override it to show the complex number in the standard format like "a + bi".

3. **How would you implement other operations like division or subtraction for complex numbers?**
   - **Answer:** For subtraction, we would create a method similar to addition but subtract the real and imaginary parts separately. For division, we would use the complex conjugate method: multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to get a real denominator, then divide each part accordingly. The formula is: (a+bi)/(c+di) = ((ac+bd)/(c²+d²)) + ((bc-ad)/(c²+d²))i.

4. **Explain the mathematical concept behind complex number multiplication.**
   - **Answer:** When multiplying complex numbers (a+bi)(c+di), we multiply each term with each other term (like FOIL method): ac + adi + bci + bdi². Since i² equals -1, the final result is (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i. In our code, we calculate these four products separately and combine them to get the final result.

## Question 2: Inheritance and Packages

### Problem Statement
Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of inheritance and packages. Create packages P1 and P2 containing classes for 2D and 3D point coordinates.

### Solution Approach
- Create a package P1 with class TwoDim representing 2D coordinates (x, y)
- Create a package P2 with class ThreeDim extending TwoDim to represent 3D coordinates (x, y, z)
- Implement appropriate constructors and toString methods
- Demonstrate inheritance and package usage in a main program

### Code Location
- `Question_02/Main.java`
- `Question_02/P1/TwoDim.java`
- `Question_02/P2/ThreeDim.java`

### Key Concepts
- Package organization in Java
- Inheritance principles
- Access modifiers and visibility
- Method overriding

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **Explain the purpose of packages in Java.**
   - **Answer:** Packages in Java help organize related classes together, preventing naming conflicts and controlling access. They work like folders for your classes, making large projects more manageable. Packages also create a namespace so you can have classes with the same name in different packages without conflict. In our program, we use packages P1 and P2 to organize different coordinate classes.

2. **What are the different access modifiers in Java and how do they affect visibility?**
   - **Answer:** Java has four access levels:
     - `public`: Accessible from anywhere
     - `protected`: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses
     - Default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package
     - `private`: Accessible only within the same class
     
     These modifiers help control which parts of our code can access other parts, improving security and reducing unwanted dependencies.

3. **How does inheritance work across packages?**
   - **Answer:** When a class inherits from another class in a different package, it can only access the public and protected members of the parent class. Private members remain inaccessible, and default (package-private) members are only accessible if both classes are in the same package. In our code, ThreeDim can access public and protected members of TwoDim even though they're in different packages.

4. **What's the difference between `public`, `protected`, and `private` access modifiers?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - `public`: Anyone can access it from anywhere
     - `protected`: Only classes in the same package and subclasses can access it
     - `private`: Only the class itself can access it
     
     Think of it like a house: public is the front yard (everyone can see), protected is the backyard (only family and neighbors can see), and private is inside your bedroom (only you can see).

## Question 3: Abstract Classes and Polymorphism

### Problem Statement
Create a program that uses abstract classes to calculate the area of different shapes. Organize the code in packages and use polymorphism.

### Solution Approach
- Create a package P1 with an abstract class Shape with abstract methods read() and area()
- Create a package P2 with Rectangle class extending Shape
- Create a package P3 with Circle class extending Shape
- Implement a main program that accepts user input to choose and calculate the area of either shape

### Code Location
- `Question_03/Main.java`
- `Question_03/P1/Shape.java`
- `Question_03/P2/Rectangle.java`
- `Question_03/P3/Circle.java`

### Key Concepts
- Abstract classes
- Method overriding
- Runtime polymorphism
- Package organization
- User input handling

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?**
   - **Answer:** Abstract classes can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Interfaces (before Java 8) can only have abstract methods. A class can extend only one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces. Abstract classes can have constructors, instance variables, and any access modifier, while interfaces have only public static final variables. In our program, Shape is an abstract class because we wanted to provide some common structure while forcing subclasses to implement specific methods.

2. **How does polymorphism work in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In our program, both Rectangle and Circle are treated as Shape objects, but when we call shape.area(), the correct implementation is called based on the actual object type. This happens at runtime (dynamic binding), allowing us to write more flexible code that works with any Shape without knowing the exact type.

3. **When would you use an abstract class instead of an interface?**
   - **Answer:** Use an abstract class when:
     - You want to share code among closely related classes
     - You need to use access modifiers other than public
     - You need instance variables or constructors
     - You want to provide some implementation while requiring subclasses to provide others
     
     In our program, Shape is an abstract class because all shapes share the common concept of having an area, but each shape calculates it differently.

4. **Explain the concept of dynamic method dispatch.**
   - **Answer:** Dynamic method dispatch is how Java implements runtime polymorphism. When you call a method on an object, Java determines which method implementation to use based on the actual object type, not the reference type. In our program, when we call shape.area(), Java looks at the actual object (Rectangle or Circle) and calls the right area() method. This decision happens during program execution (at runtime), not during compilation.

## Question 4: Custom Exception Handling

### Problem Statement
Write a Java program that creates a custom exception class to validate voting age. If a person's age is less than 18, throw an UnderAge exception.

### Solution Approach
- Create a custom exception class UnderAge extending Exception
- Implement a method to check age and throw the exception if under 18
- Handle the exception in the main program
- Take user input for age and display appropriate messages

### Code Location
`Question_04/Main.java`

### Key Concepts
- Custom exception creation
- Exception handling with try-catch blocks
- User input validation
- Extending the Exception class

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**
   - **Answer:** Checked exceptions must be either caught (with try-catch) or declared (with throws) in the method signature. They're checked by the compiler. Examples include IOException and SQLException. Unchecked exceptions (also called Runtime exceptions) don't need to be explicitly caught or declared. Examples include NullPointerException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Our UnderAge exception is a checked exception because it extends the Exception class directly.

2. **When should you create custom exceptions?**
   - **Answer:** Create custom exceptions when:
     - Standard exceptions don't clearly express your specific error condition
     - You want to add custom information to the exception
     - You want to group related error conditions
     - You need to distinguish your application's exceptions from standard ones
     
     In our program, UnderAge clearly communicates that the error is specifically about age requirements, which is more meaningful than using a generic exception.

3. **Explain the exception hierarchy in Java.**
   - **Answer:** At the top is Throwable, which has two main subclasses: Error and Exception. Errors represent serious problems that applications shouldn't try to handle (like OutOfMemoryError). Exceptions represent conditions that applications might want to handle. RuntimeException (a subclass of Exception) and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions. All other exceptions are checked. Our UnderAge extends Exception directly, making it a checked exception.

4. **What's the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**
   - **Answer:** The `finally` block contains code that always executes, whether an exception occurs or not. It's typically used for cleanup operations like closing files, database connections, or network connections. This ensures resources are properly released even if an exception happens. In modern Java, try-with-resources can often replace finally blocks for resource management, as we did in our program with the Scanner object.

## Question 6: File Copy Program

### Problem Statement
Write a Java program that copies content from one file to another using command-line arguments to specify source and destination files.

### Solution Approach
- Accept source and destination file names as command-line arguments
- Use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream for binary file copying
- Implement proper exception handling for file operations
- Display appropriate success and error messages

### Code Location
`Question_06/Main.java`

### Key Concepts
- Command-line argument processing
- File I/O operations
- Exception handling for I/O operations
- Resource management with try-with-resources

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How do you handle file operations in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Java provides several classes for file operations:
     - File: represents file paths
     - FileInputStream/FileOutputStream: for binary data
     - FileReader/FileWriter: for character data
     - BufferedReader/BufferedWriter: for efficient character data reading/writing
     
     In our program, we use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream because they work with any file type, not just text. We also use try-with-resources to automatically close the streams.

2. **What is the try-with-resources statement and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Try-with-resources automatically closes resources that implement AutoCloseable (like streams) when the try block exits. It's important because it prevents resource leaks even if exceptions occur. Before Java 7, we had to use finally blocks to close resources manually, which was more verbose and error-prone. In our program, the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream are automatically closed, even if an exception occurs.

3. **What's the difference between FileInputStream/FileOutputStream and FileReader/FileWriter?**
   - **Answer:** FileInputStream/FileOutputStream handle binary data (bytes) and work with any file type. FileReader/FileWriter handle character data and are specifically for text files, using the default character encoding. If you need to specify a different encoding for text, you'd use InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter wrapped around FileInputStream/FileOutputStream. We use the binary streams in our program because they're more versatile.

4. **How would you modify this program to handle very large files efficiently?**
   - **Answer:** For large files:
     - Use buffered streams (BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream) to reduce the number of disk accesses
     - Read/write in larger chunks (e.g., 8KB buffer instead of byte by byte)
     - Consider using memory-mapped files (FileChannel with map()) for very large files
     - Use NIO channels for more efficient transfers
     - Consider processing the file in chunks rather than loading it all into memory
     
     The key is to minimize disk I/O operations and manage memory efficiently.

## Question 7: Comment Line Extractor

### Problem Statement
Write a Java program that reads a Java source file and extracts all comment lines (lines starting with //).

### Solution Approach
- Use BufferedReader with FileReader to read the source file line by line
- Check if each line starts with // after trimming whitespace
- Print all comment lines to the console
- Implement proper exception handling for file operations

### Code Location
`Question_07/Main.java`

### Key Concepts
- Text file reading operations
- String manipulation and comparison
- File processing algorithms
- Buffered I/O for efficiency

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How would you modify this program to extract multi-line comments (/* ... */)?**
   - **Answer:** To extract multi-line comments:
     - Keep a boolean flag to track if we're inside a multi-line comment
     - Turn the flag on when /* is encountered and off when */ is encountered
     - Handle nested comments if required
     - Print lines when the flag is on or when they start with //
     
     This would require checking for comment start/end markers within each line, not just at the beginning.

2. **What's the advantage of using BufferedReader over FileReader directly?**
   - **Answer:** BufferedReader adds buffering, meaning it reads a chunk of characters at once and keeps them in memory. This significantly reduces the number of disk reads, making the program much faster. It also provides convenient methods like readLine() to read a whole line at once. FileReader alone would require reading character by character, which is much slower. In our program, the efficiency difference becomes significant when processing large files.

3. **How would you handle files with different character encodings?**
   - **Answer:** Instead of using FileReader directly, use:
     ```java
     BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
         new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(filename), "UTF-8"));
     ```
     Replace "UTF-8" with whatever encoding you need. This approach gives you explicit control over the character encoding, rather than using the platform default. This is important for files created on different systems or in specific encodings.

4. **What are some optimization techniques for processing large text files?**
   - **Answer:** To optimize large file processing:
     - Use buffered readers with an appropriate buffer size
     - Process the file in a single pass where possible
     - Consider memory-mapped files for very large files
     - Use parallel processing for independent chunks
     - Avoid creating unnecessary String objects
     - Consider using NIO for non-blocking I/O
     - Filter data early to reduce memory needs
     
     The key is to minimize both disk I/O and memory usage while processing efficiently.

## Question 9: Frame with Pink Background

### Problem Statement
Write a program to display a string in frame window with pink color as background.

### Solution Approach
- Create a Frame and customize its appearance with a title and size
- Set the background color to pink
- Add a label to display text
- Make the frame visible

### Code Location
`Question_09/PinkFrame.java`

### Key Concepts
- Basic AWT components (Frame, Label)
- Color manipulation in GUI
- Simple layout management
- Basic window configuration

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is the difference between AWT and Swing?**
   - **Answer:** AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is Java's original GUI toolkit that uses native components from the operating system. Swing is built on top of AWT but creates pure Java components, making them look the same across all platforms. Swing components are more customizable, lightweight, and have more features than AWT components. In our program, we use AWT components like Frame and Label.

2. **Why should GUI operations be performed on the Event Dispatching Thread?**
   - **Answer:** GUI operations should be on the EDT because Swing is not thread-safe. Running GUI operations on different threads can cause unpredictable behavior, strange visual artifacts, or crashes. The EDT ensures GUI operations happen in sequence without conflicts. This applies to both Swing and AWT applications, although many simple AWT applications like ours might work without explicit EDT usage.

3. **Explain the component hierarchy in AWT.**
   - **Answer:** AWT components form a tree structure:
     - At the top is usually a Frame (window)
     - Frames can contain Panels or other containers
     - These containers can hold components like buttons, labels, or more panels
     
     This hierarchy is important because properties like visibility, enabled state, and events can be affected by parent components. In our program, Frame contains a Label, which is a simple example of this hierarchy.

4. **How do you handle colors in Java GUI applications?**
   - **Answer:** Java provides a Color class to represent colors, with predefined constants like Color.PINK, Color.RED, etc. You can also create custom colors using RGB values, HSB values, or hex codes. Components have setBackground() and setForeground() methods to change their colors. In our program, we use setBackground(Color.PINK) to set the frame's background color.

## Question 10: Background Color Changer

### Problem Statement
Write a program to create an application that has two buttons named "Red" and "Blue". When a button is pressed the background color of the application window is set to the color named by the button's label.

### Solution Approach
- Create a Frame window with two buttons for different colors
- Implement ActionListener to handle button click events
- Change the background color based on which button is clicked
- Use appropriate layout and positioning for the components

### Code Location
`Question_10/BgChanger.java`

### Key Concepts
- Button components
- Event handling with ActionListener
- Dynamic background color changing
- Basic AWT components and layouts

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How does event handling work in Java AWT/Swing?**
   - **Answer:** Java uses a delegation event model:
     - Components generate events when user actions occur
     - Listener objects register interest in specific events (using addXXXListener methods)
     - When an event happens, the component "notifies" all registered listeners
     - Each listener's appropriate method is called to handle the event
     
     This separates the UI components from application logic, making code more organized and maintainable.

2. **What's the event handling mechanism in Java GUI applications?**
   - **Answer:** Java uses a delegation event model:
     - Components generate events when user actions occur
     - Listener objects register interest in specific events
     - When an event happens, the component "notifies" all registered listeners
     - Each listener's appropriate method is called to handle the event
     
     This separates the user interface (components) from the application logic (listeners), making code more organized and maintainable.

3. **How do you change component properties dynamically?**
   - **Answer:** To change properties dynamically:
     - Get a reference to the component you want to change
     - Call the appropriate setter method (like setBackground(), setText())
     - If needed, call revalidate() to update the layout and repaint() to update the visual appearance
     
     For background color, we would use component.setBackground(newColor) followed by component.repaint() if needed.

## Question 11: Key Event Demo

### Problem Statement
Create an application which responds to KEY_TYPED event and updates the status window with message ("Typed character is: X").

### Solution Approach
- Create a Frame with a text field for user input
- Add a label to display the typed character
- Implement KeyListener interface to handle key events
- Update the label text when a key is typed

### Code Location
`Question_11/KeyTyped.java`

### Key Concepts
- Key event handling
- KeyListener interface implementation
- Dynamic UI updates based on user input
- Basic AWT components

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What are adapter classes in Java and why are they useful?**
   - **Answer:** Adapter classes provide empty implementations of all methods in a listener interface. They're useful when you only need to implement one or two methods from a listener interface with many methods. Instead of implementing all methods yourself, you can extend the adapter class and override only the methods you need. For example, KeyAdapter lets you override just keyTyped() without implementing keyPressed() and keyReleased() if you don't need them.

2. **Explain the difference between KEY_TYPED, KEY_PRESSED, and KEY_RELEASED events.**
   - **Answer:** 
     - KEY_TYPED: Generated when a key is typed (pressed and released) and produces a character. It doesn't fire for keys like Shift or Control that don't produce characters.
     - KEY_PRESSED: Generated when any key is physically pushed down, including action keys.
     - KEY_RELEASED: Generated when any key is physically released.
     
     For character input, KEY_TYPED is usually most appropriate because it handles keyboard layouts and gives you the actual character. KEY_PRESSED/RELEASED are better for detecting special keys like function keys.

3. **How would you implement keyboard focus management in a Java application?**
   - **Answer:** For keyboard focus management:
     - Use component.requestFocus() to give a component keyboard focus
     - Use component.setFocusable(true) to allow a component to receive focus
     - Create a FocusListener to respond to focus events
     - Use KeyboardFocusManager for more complex focus control
     - Use tab ordering via container.setFocusTraversalKeys() for natural keyboard navigation
     
     Good focus management improves usability, especially for keyboard-only users and accessibility.

## Question 12: Student Information Application

### Problem Statement
Create an application with two buttons labeled 'A' and 'B'. When button 'A' is pressed, it displays your personal information (Name, Course, Roll No, and College) and when button 'B' is pressed, it displays your CGPA in previous semester.

### Solution Approach
- Create a Frame window as the main container
- Add two buttons for different information display
- Create labels to display various pieces of information
- Implement ActionListener to update displayed information based on button clicks

### Code Location
`Question_12/PersonalInfo.java`

### Key Concepts
- Button components and event handling
- Display of information based on user actions
- Layout management
- Dynamic UI updates

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How would you structure a modern Java application to display information based on user input?**
   - **Answer:** In a modern application:
     - Use MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate data, display, and logic
     - Create a model to hold student information data
     - Create a view using JavaFX or Swing components
     - Use controller classes to handle button click events
     - Update the view when model data changes
     
     This separation makes the application easier to modify and maintain compared to putting everything in one class.

2. **What design patterns might be useful for organizing code in a GUI application?**
   - **Answer:** Useful patterns include:
     - MVC (Model-View-Controller): Separates data, display, and logic
     - Observer: Notifies components when data changes
     - Strategy: Switches display behavior based on context
     - Factory: Creates appropriate UI components
     - Singleton: Manages shared resources
     
     These patterns make code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain, especially for complex GUI applications.

3. **How would you validate and format text in a Java GUI application?**
   - **Answer:** For text validation and formatting:
     - Use JFormattedTextField for formatted input (dates, numbers)
     - Create InputVerifier objects for custom validation
     - Use DocumentFilter to restrict input as it's typed
     - Display error messages in JLabels or dialog boxes
     - Use regular expressions for pattern validation
     
     Good validation improves user experience by preventing errors and providing immediate feedback.

## Question 14: Color Chooser Application (Swing)

### Problem Statement
Write a program to create a color chooser application with buttons for different colors. When a button is clicked, the background color of the application changes to match the button color.

### Solution Approach
- Create a JFrame with a main panel
- Add buttons for red and blue colors
- Use ActionListener to change background color when buttons are clicked
- Implement appropriate layout and positioning

### Code Location
`Question_14/BgChangerSwing.java`

### Key Concepts
- Event handling in Swing (ActionListener)
- Dynamic UI updates
- Swing components (JFrame, JButton)
- Anonymous inner classes for event handling

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How does event handling work in Java Swing?**
   - **Answer:** Swing event handling works like this:
     - Create a listener class that implements an interface like ActionListener
     - Override methods like actionPerformed() to handle events
     - Register the listener with components using methods like addActionListener()
     - When the user interacts with the component, the appropriate method is called
     
     In our program, we use ActionListener to react when buttons are clicked, changing the background color dynamically.

2. **Explain the different layout managers available in Swing.**
   - **Answer:** Common Swing layouts include:
     - BorderLayout: Divides space into North, South, East, West, and Center regions
     - FlowLayout: Arranges components in a row, wrapping as needed
     - GridLayout: Creates a grid of equal-sized cells
     - BoxLayout: Arranges components in a single row or column
     - GridBagLayout: Most flexible but complex layout with weighted cells
     
     Our program uses null layout for manual positioning of components.

3. **What's the difference between AWT and Swing components?**
   - **Answer:** AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is Java's original GUI toolkit that uses native components from the operating system. Swing is built on top of AWT but creates pure Java components, making them look the same across all platforms. Swing components are more customizable, lightweight, and have more features than AWT components. In our program, we use Swing components like JFrame and JButton instead of their AWT equivalents Frame and Button.

4. **What's the purpose of SwingUtilities.invokeLater() method?**
   - **Answer:** SwingUtilities.invokeLater() schedules a task to run on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). This is important because Swing components should only be accessed from the EDT to prevent threading issues. When creating a GUI, we wrap the initialization code in invokeLater() to ensure it runs on the EDT, preventing potential bugs or visual glitches that could occur if multiple threads try to update the UI simultaneously.

## Question 15: Key Event Demonstration (Swing)

### Problem Statement
Write a program that responds to keyboard events and displays information about each key event (key typed) in a label.

### Solution Approach
- Create a JFrame with a text field for input
- Implement KeyListener interface to capture keyboard events
- Display typed character information in a label
- Use anonymous inner class for event handling

### Code Location
`Question_15/KeyTypedSwing.java`

### Key Concepts
- Keyboard event handling (KeyListener)
- Key events in Swing
- Text components in Swing (JTextField, JLabel)
- Using KeyAdapter for simpler event handling

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What are the three types of key events in Java and how do they differ?**
   - **Answer:** The three key events are:
     - keyTyped: Generated when a key is typed (pressed and released) and produces a character. Only provides the character, not the key code.
     - keyPressed: Generated when a key is physically pushed down. Provides the key code but not necessarily a character.
     - keyReleased: Generated when a key is physically released. Also provides the key code.
     
     In our program, we display the keyTyped event to show the character that was typed.

2. **How would you detect when a specific combination of keys is pressed?**
   - **Answer:** To detect key combinations:
     - Use the keyPressed event (not keyTyped)
     - Check the key code of the current key using e.getKeyCode()
     - Check for modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) using e.isControlDown(), e.isAltDown(), etc.
     - For complex combinations, track the state of currently pressed keys in a Set
     
     For example, to detect Ctrl+S: check if e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_S && e.isControlDown()

3. **What's the difference between low-level and semantic events in Swing?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - Low-level events: Direct user interactions like mouse clicks, key presses, and window resizing. Examples: MouseEvent, KeyEvent, WindowEvent.
     - Semantic events: Higher-level, meaningful actions in the application. Examples: ActionEvent (for buttons), ItemEvent (for checkboxes), DocumentEvent (for text changes).
     
     Low-level events tell how something happened; semantic events tell what happened. In general, use semantic events when possible for cleaner, more maintainable code.

4. **What's the advantage of using KeyAdapter over implementing KeyListener directly?**
   - **Answer:** KeyAdapter is an adapter class that implements KeyListener with empty methods. The main advantage is that you only need to override the methods you're interested in, rather than implementing all three methods (keyPressed, keyReleased, keyTyped) required by the KeyListener interface. This results in cleaner, more focused code, especially when you only care about one type of key event, as in our application that only uses keyTyped.

When the "Academic Information" button is pressed, it displays the student's CGPA in the previous semester.

### Solution Approach
- Create a JFrame with a panel to display information
- Add two buttons for different information types
- Use actionListeners to update the display panel when buttons are clicked
- Arrange components with appropriate layout managers

### Code Location
`Question_16/PersonalInfoSwing.java`

### Key Concepts

### Potential Interview Questions and Answers

1. **How would you implement a more complex form with input validation in Swing?**
   - **Answer:** For a complex form with validation:
     - Create a structured form with JLabels and input components (JTextField, JComboBox, etc.)
     - Create validator methods for each field
     - Use InputVerifier or DocumentFilter for immediate validation
     - Add validation when the form is submitted
     - Display error messages next to invalid fields
     - Disable the submit button until all fields are valid
     
     This approach provides both real-time feedback and final validation before submission.

2. **What are the advantages of Swing components over AWT components?**
   - **Answer:** Swing advantages include:
     - Platform-independent look and feel
     - More components available (like JTable, JTree)
     - MVC architecture making components more flexible
     - Lightweight components using less resources
     - Customizable appearance (with look and feel)
     - Double buffering for smoother graphics
     
     These advantages make Swing better for complex GUI applications, though modern Java applications might use JavaFX instead of either AWT or Swing.

3. **How can you center components in Swing?**
   - **Answer:** To center components:
     - For centering in a container: Use GridBagLayout or BorderLayout.CENTER
     - For horizontal centering of text in a label: Use label.setHorizontalAlignment(JLabel.CENTER)
     - For centering a component within available space: Use Box.createHorizontalGlue() and Box.createVerticalGlue()
     - For centering a window on screen: Use frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null)
     
     In our application, we use null layout for manual positioning.

4. **Explain the concept of revalidate() and repaint() methods in Swing.**
   - **Answer:** 
     - revalidate(): Tells the layout manager to recalculate the container's layout. Use it when you add, remove, or change the visibility of components.
     - repaint(): Requests that a component redraws itself. Use it when you change a component's appearance like color or text.
     
     These methods are important when dynamically changing component properties or visibility to ensure the UI displays correctly.

## Common Compilation and Execution Issues

1. **ClassNotFoundException**: Ensure you're in the correct directory when running the program.
2. **NoClassDefFoundError**: Check for typos in class names or package structure.
3. **UnsupportedClassVersionError**: Your Java runtime is older than the compiled class version.
4. **ExceptionInInitializerError**: An exception occurred during static initialization.

## Debugging Tips

1. Use `System.out.println()` statements to track program flow.
2. For Swing GUI issues, add borders to components to visualize layout problems.
3. For thread-related issues, ensure proper synchronization and EDT usage.
4. For custom painting issues, override `paintComponent()` not `paint()` or `update()`.
